A simple, functional desktop calculator built using Python and `tkinter`. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations with a clean and responsive GUI.

## 🖥️ Description

This project is a minimalistic calculator application that can perform:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Built using Python's built-in `tkinter` library, it features a user-friendly interface and handles invalid inputs gracefully by displaying an error message.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python calculator.py
The calculator GUI will open.

🧠 How It Works
Buttons for digits 0–9, operators (+, -, *, /), clear (C), and equals (=) are arranged in a grid layout.

Input is displayed in the entry field.

The result is computed using Python’s built-in eval() function when = is pressed.

Errors (like syntax mistakes) are caught and displayed as "Errror" in the entry field.

Let me know if you'd like me to:
- Create a `requirements.txt` file (though it's not strictly needed here),
- Add installation instructions for Windows/Mac/Linux,
- Help you package this as an `.exe` with PyInstaller.
